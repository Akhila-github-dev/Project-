@RestController
@RequestMapping("/staff")
public class StaffController {

    private final StaffService staffService;

    public StaffController(StaffService staffService) {
        this.staffService = staffService;
    }

here we have used parameterized constructor (constructor injection) or else we can use @Autowired for field injection
but in real time we use constuctor injection. this will make sure class is immutable
