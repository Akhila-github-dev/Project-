client <=> filter -> dispatcher servlet -> controller -> service Impl -> Dao

in service Impl we have Dto, model, builders, loggers ,exceptions , notification(mail notification)

client is our UI (fronted)
before going to controller (we will do filters like authentication and authorization using Jwt) 

in spring application we need dipatcher servlet
in spring boot will auto configure the dispatcher servlet(auto confiure)

Controller - we will write APIs
Service - business Logic  
DAO- repos data access object (data base operations are done here)
